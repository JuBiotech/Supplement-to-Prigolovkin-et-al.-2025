Supplementary Figure 1: Kinetic trajectories in turbidity assay remain unaffected upon 8 months storage of the indicator strain at -80 °C. **a** S. carnosus TM300 suspension from a frozen cell pellet aliquot stored at -20 °C for 1 day was used for turbidity assay. **b** *S. carnosus TM300* suspension was prepared from a frozen cell pellet aliquot that was stored at -80 °C for 8 months. Absorbance at 600 nm of the indicator strain suspensions (OD=2) were measured upon exposure to lysostaphin standard (0-10 mg/L) in kinetic cycles for 60 min using a microplate reader. Mean and standard deviation of n=3 technical replicates are shown.
